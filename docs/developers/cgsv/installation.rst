..  warning::

    When you install this version, you may run into code that does not yet
    work correctly, or code whose APIs don't match what is described in the
    documentation.

    Although the project makes an effort to ensure code in the ``master``
    branch is kept working and consistent with documentation,
    this may not always be the case.

Use ``pip`` to install the most recent version in the ``master`` branch::

    $ pip install 'https://github.com/metrasynth/sunvox-guide/#egg=sunvox-guide'

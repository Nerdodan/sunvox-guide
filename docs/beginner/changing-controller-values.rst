================================
Changing controller values [TBW]
================================

Every module except for the Output module has some controllers.
These controllers have a number of functions depending on the type of module.
Some alter the synthesis of sound, some change effects - there are many purposes for these controllers, and if you want the details on each one, check the reference section of this book.

To the left of the module pane is the control pane.
In here you can see the controls for whichever module you have selected.
With a few exceptions, these controls appear as sliders.
You can tap on them with a finger and drag them back and forth, or click and drag with a mouse.

If you want to, you can also right click on the controls or double tap, and open the Controller properties window, in which you can either move a slider for the controller value, or type one in directly.

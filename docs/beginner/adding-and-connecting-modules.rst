===================================
Adding and connecting modules [WIP]
===================================

Open sunvox, and look at your screen layout. You can see that it is divided
into two, three or four panes, separated strips. You can tap and drag, or
click and drag these strips to resize the panes. Make sure that none of the
panes are hidden, by dragging the strips around so that you can see all
the panes.

If you can see three panes, you may have your interface set not to show the
timeline pane by default. On small screens, this is efficient but on larger
screens it does not help you much. If you want to change this, go to the main
menu -> preferences -> timeline, and change the Show Timeline setting.

If you see four panes, look at the middle two. The one one the right hand side,
that contains small oblongs (at least one called Output) is where we will work.

If you see three panes, it's the one in the bottom right hand corner.
If you see two panes, then the bottom one is the timeline, and is not what we
need right now. You should see an icon at the top right hand corner of the
timeline pane, which looks like two boxes connected by a dogleg line.
Touch or click that icon to get to the three pane view with the module pane.

Let's get a clean start. Open the main menu, and select new project.
This should open a little box that lets you choose Template, Empty or Cancel.
Select Empty.

You should now see a module pane that is blank, except for an Output module.
We will create a basic module setup in this space now. Double-tap, or
right-click in the pane, on a blank spot. You should have a menu.

If you used a mouse, you should have a menu that offers you the chance to add
a module. Select this, and you should see a list of modules you can add.

If you used your finger, it should jump straight ahead to where you see a list
of modules to add.

Select the Generator module, and hit OK. You should see a new Generator module
in your view, marked with some blinking brackets at its corners.

Let's do that again, and this time add an Echo module.

We want a signal to go from the Generator, to the Echo, to the Output.
This will give us a sound from the Generator, that echoes inside the Echo
module, and will end up in Output so that we can hear it.

Touch or click on Generator so that you see flashing brackets at its corners.
Then click or touch the module link button in the upper right hand corner of
the pane (it looks like two boxes connected by a dogleg line), then click or
touch the Echo module. You should see a line running from Generator to Echo,
with little lights travelling in that direction.

Now do the same again, highlighting Echo and drawing a line to Output.

In the top pane, do you see the keyboard? It looks like a piano keyboard.
Touch that, to hear your sound. Can you hear it echo? That means you did this
correctly - this is the basic groundwork of adding modules to design your own
sounds in sunvox.

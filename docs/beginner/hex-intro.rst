Introduction to Hex Notation

Hex notation is just another way of writing numbers.

In normal decimal notation (what you're probably used to) you have:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20

In hexadecimal (or hex, for short) this becomes:

  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f 10 11 12 13 14

The way this works is that instead of running from 0 through 9, digits run from 0 through 15.
However, since we don't have digits for 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 or 15, we use letters.
So, a means 10, b means 11 and so on.

This change also extends to the positions of digits.
In regular decimal notation, if you have two digits the first one counts tens.
If you have three digits, the first one counts hundreds, the second counts tens and so on.
In hexadecimal, you don't need a special position to count tens, because you can simply write a and have a ten.
Instead, you have a digit that counts sixteens.
The next digit up from that counts two hundred and fifty-sixes.

This is why 14 in hexadecimal corresponds to 20 in decimal.
1 times sixteen, plus 4 times one is twenty.

People largely use hex notation in tracking software for historic reasons, but it does happen to fit well with the quarter note breakdown typical of music.
All it takes is understanding, then practice and it will be second nature.

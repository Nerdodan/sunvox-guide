Arranging patterns in the timeline [WIP]
========================================

The timeline is where you arrange your music. As the music plays, you can
watch the playhead bar moving along the timeline. If you want to get your
sounds happening at the right time, you need to move the patterns that play
those sounds to the right place in the timeline.

You can use a mouse to click and drag a pattern around the timeline, or your
finger to touch and drag them the same way.

Vertical positioning of a pattern in the timeline does not matter. This means
that you can put a few patterns next to each other, vertically arranged, and
the music in them will play at the same time.

Horizontal positioning of the pattern affects when in your music the sounds
in that pattern will play. This is also why longer patterns are horizontally
longer in the pattern display.

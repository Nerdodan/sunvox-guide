Authoring and editing
=====================

We recommend that you set up a local environment for authoring and editing.
This book makes extensive use of figures and audio samples,
which are generated by a documentation builder.

Bug reports for documentation builder
-------------------------------------

When `reporting a bug <https://github.com/metrasynth/sunvox-guide/issues>`_
please include:

    * Your operating system name and version.
    * Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
    * Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Setting up the documentation builder
------------------------------------

1.  Fork `sunvox-guide <https://github.com/metrasynth/sunvox-guide>`_
    (look for the "Fork" button).

2.  Clone your fork locally::

        git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/sunvox-guide

3.  Create a branch for local development::

        git checkout -b name-of-what-you-are-working-on

    Now you can make your changes locally.

4.  Run this command to automatically rebuild documentation
    every time you make changes::

        cd docs
        watchmedo shell-command -c "make html" -p '*.rst' -i '_build/*' -w -W -R .

    If you need to rebuild all pages, run this::

        cd docs
        rm -rf _build/doctrees

5.  Open the ``sunvox-guide/docs/_build/html/index.html`` file in your
    web browser to review the changes.

6.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

        git add .
        git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
        git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

If you need some code review or feedback while you're authoring or editing,
just make the pull request and begin discussion.

Once you are finished, another editor will assist with proofreading
and will merge the results into the official repository.

Before merging, you should:

1. Ensure all added or changed files render without errors.
2. Add yourself to ``AUTHORS.rst``.

Who is this book for?
=====================

This book is for anyone interested in SunVox, the music studio app
you can use on almost any computer.

Here are some of the types of people who might enjoy this book:

Beginner musicians
  Learn about music by using SunVox to compose songs
  using simple techniques. As you progress, you can add more
  layers and sounds to your projects.

Professional musicians
  Use SunVox by itself to create your next masterpiece,
  or connect it to the rest of your music studio.

Sound designers
  Create and discover exciting new timbres using SunVox's powerful
  audio engine. Complex synths and effects can be
  bundled into easy-to-use *MetaModules*, making them easy to
  organize and easy to share with others.

Developers of apps and games
  Embed SunVox music and sound effects into your next game using the
  royalty-free SunVox DLL. Develop

Chiptune and tracker enthusiasts
  If you already know what trackers are, and like the sound of chiptunes,
  enjoy SunVox's blend of a familiar tracker interface and
  modern synthesis tools.


What is SunVox?
===============

From the `SunVox home page`_:

    SunVox is a small, fast and powerful modular synthesizer with pattern-based
    sequencer (tracker). It is a tool for those people who like to compose music
    wherever they are, whenever they wish. On any device. SunVox is available
    for Windows, OS X, Linux, Maemo, Meego, Raspberry Pi, Windows Mobile
    (WindowsCE), PalmOS, iOS and Android.

What is a modular synthesizer?
==============================

*Synthesizers*, or *synths*, are electronic instruments that receives musical
notes and other commands, transform them into sounds, and send out audio signals.

SunVox is a *modular synthesizer*, a synth that is composed of
smaller components that can be easily *patched* (connected and
disconnected from each other) to create complex sounds.

(In contrast, non-modular synths usually have parameters you can change,
but do not allow rearranging their internal structures.)


What is a pattern-based sequencer?
==================================

*Sequencers* send a pre-programmed notes and other commands
to synthesizers. The notes and commands are sent at precise times,
following the tempo of the music being played.

SunVox is a *pattern-based sequencer*, which lets you create groups of these
notes and commands. Each of these groups is called a *pattern*. This makes it
easy to rearrange music, and to repeat sections more than once.


What is a tracker?
==================

SunVox offers a *tracker* interface, which is a way of programming sequencer
patterns by placing notes and commands into a grid of *tracks* and *lines*.

Tracks are arranged horizontally, and lines are arranged vertically.
As a pattern plays, the sequencer steps through each line in the pattern,
following the current tempo.

The currently-playing line of a pattern is then scanned for notes and
commands in each track. Everything on that line is then sent to synthesizer
modules, and played back at the same time.


What makes SunVox unique compared to similar apps?
==================================================

- SunVox is one of the lowest-priced modular synths on the market.
  It's free on most supported platforms, and very affordable on others.

- The powerful *timeline* interface used to arrange patterns is unlike
  any other

- You can create, share, and modify complex module setups using
  *MetaModules*.

- It uses the same interface on all platforms. Learn SunVox concepts once,
  then use the same and techniques and project files on any supported platform.

- For developers, a royalty-free DLL is available. You can embed
  SunVox music and sound effects into your app.


How to read this book
=====================

Beginners may want to read the book sequentially, to build up an
understanding of basic concepts before moving to more advanced topics.

Intermediate and expert-level SunVox users may want to skip some of the
basics and jump to more advanced topics right away, or use this book
as a reference manual.

To help you get the most from the book regardless of how you read it,
we'll offer images, animated GIFs, diagrams, links to other sections,
audio samples, and downloadable SunVox projects.
